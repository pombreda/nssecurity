; This is a sample configuration file for the netscape plugin security wrapper.
;
; The purpose of this plugin is to add additional access controls to netscape
; plugins deployed to corporate workstations.
;
;   AllowInsecure           Do not require https for domains listed in
;                           AllowDomains (not recommended).
;
;   FriendlyWarning         Optional message displayed to user when a plugin is
;                           disallowed.
;
;   LoadPlugin              Filename of a plugin you want wrapped with the
;                           security wrapper.
;
;   AllowedDomains          List of domains you want to allow to load this
;                           plugin.
;
;   PluginDescription       Description displayed by the browser when a user
;                           looks at about:plugins (Linux Only, Apple use the
;                           Contents of Info.plist)
;
;   NotifyCommand           Execute this command when a plugin does not match
;                           any AllowedDomains. This is intended to display a
;                           notification to the user, or give them instructions
;                           to contact support.
;
;   SyslogPolicyDecisions   Log policy decisions to syslog. This is intended to
;                           help debug new policies, by allowing administrators
;                           to collect statistics on the most commonly used
;                           domains.
;
;                           It can be used to gradually roll out new policies
;                           by setting AllowedDomains=*, and then collecting
;                           the most common users before restricting it.
