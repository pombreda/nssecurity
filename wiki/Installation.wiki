= Installation =

== Mac OS X ==

To install the plugin on Mac OS X, you should move the plugins you wish to manage from their default path (which is typically `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins`) to a new location, such as `/Library/Third Party Plug-Ins`. This prevents browsers from loading the plugin.

Now copy the NetscapeSecurityWrapper.plugin file from the installation `.dmg` into `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins`.

== Linux ==

Linux plugins are typically installed in `/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins`, but this varies by distribution. Create a new directory, such as `/usr/lib/thirdparty`, and move the plugins you would like to manage into this new directory.

Now install the Netscape Security Wrapper into the original plugin directory.

= Configuration =

You will need to create an nssecurity.ini file, as documented in NetscapeSecurity.

Start an NPAPI compatible browser, and verify that the plugin is displayed in about:plugins, and that you see the MIME types you were expecting.
